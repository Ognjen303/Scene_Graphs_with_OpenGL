# Scene_Graphs_with_OpenGL
This project extension from part of course from Computer Science department of University of Cambridge.

In this project, I animated a scene using Scene Graphs and rasterization. I used the Phong Illumination model with added reflection from the skybox to light up the scene. Here, I improved my knowledge in rendering, shading, transforming object using MVP matrices, animation, scene graphs, rasterization, texturing and cubemaps.
